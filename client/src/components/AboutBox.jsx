                We understand the struggle of constantly finding the perfect outfit for themed parties. 
                That’s why we created Campus Closet—a platform built by students, for students.

            <p>
                We believe in making themed party dressing affordable and sustainable. 
                Our goal is to help students buy, sell, and rent outfits for every occasion.
